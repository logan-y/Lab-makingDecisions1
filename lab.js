/*
  Using an if statement and a comparison operator, 
  create code that will log a suggestion on what type of clothes 
  one should wear for the day, based on the above temperature and rain.
  If it is 80 degrees or above, and raining, 
  one should wear a t-shirt and take an umbrella. 
  If it is between 60 and 80 degrees, and raining, 
  one should wear a rain-jacket. If it is 60 degrees or below, 
  one should wear a jacket and carry an umbrella.
  Come up with your own clothing suggestions based on those 
  temperature parameters when it is not raining.
